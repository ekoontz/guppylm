> **This project exists to show that training your own language model is not magic.**
> No PhD required. No massive GPU cluster. One Colab notebook, 5 minutes, and you have a working LLM that you built from scratch — data generation, tokenizer, model architecture, training loop, and inference. If you can run a notebook, you can train a language model.
>
> It won't produce a billion-parameter model that writes essays. But it will show you exactly how every piece works — from raw text to trained weights to generated output — so the big models stop feeling like black boxes.

```
You> hi guppy
Guppy> hi there. i just found a nice spot near the rock. the temperature feels nice.

You> are you hungry
Guppy> yes. always yes. i will swim to the top right now. i promise to eat all of it.

You> do you like bubbles
Guppy> i love bubbles. they make the water feel slightly different.

You> what is the meaning of life
Guppy> food. the answer is always food.

You> tell me a joke
Guppy> what did the fish say when it hit the wall. dam.

You> do you love me
Guppy> you're my favorite big shape. my mouth are happy when you're here.

You> goodnight guppy
Guppy> ok sleep time. i was following a bubble but now i'll stop. goodnight tank. goodnight water.

## What is GuppyLM?

GuppyLM is a tiny language model that pretends to be a fish named Guppy. It speaks in short, lowercase sentences about water, food, light, and tank life. It doesn't understand human abstractions like money, phones, or politics — and it's not trying to.

It's trained from scratch on 60K synthetic conversations across 60 topics, runs on a single GPU in ~5 minutes, and produces a model small enough to run in a browser.

## Architecture

| | |
|---|---|
| **Parameters** | 8.7M |
| **Layers** | 6 |
| **Hidden dim** | 384 |
| **Heads** | 6 |
| **FFN** | 768 (ReLU) |
| **Vocab** | 4,096 (BPE) |
| **Max sequence** | 128 tokens |
| **Norm** | LayerNorm |
| **Position** | Learned embeddings |
| **LM head** | Weight-tied with embeddings |

Vanilla transformer. No GQA, no RoPE, no SwiGLU, no early exit. As simple as it gets.

## Personality

Guppy:
- Speaks in short, lowercase sentences
- Experiences the world through water, temperature, light, vibrations, and food
- Doesn't understand human abstractions
- Is friendly, curious, and a little dumb
- Thinks about food a lot

**60 topics:** greetings, feelings, temperature, food, light, water, tank, noise, night, loneliness, bubbles, glass, reflection, breathing, swimming, colors, taste, plants, filter, algae, snails, scared, excited, bored, curious, happy, tired, outside, cats, rain, seasons, music, visitors, children, meaning of life, time, memory, dreams, size, future, past, name, weather, sleep, friends, jokes, fear, love, age, intelligence, health, singing, TV, and more.

## Quick Start

### Try in Browser (no install needed)

[![Try in Browser](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try_in-Browser-64ffda?logo=webassembly)](https://arman-bd.github.io/guppylm/)

Runs entirely in your browser via WebAssembly. Downloads a quantized ONNX model (~10 MB) and runs inference locally — no server, no API keys.

### Chat with Guppy in Colab

[![Open in Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chat_in-Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/arman-bd/guppylm/blob/main/use_guppylm.ipynb)

Downloads the pre-trained model from HuggingFace and lets you chat. Just run all cells.

### Train your own on Colab

[![Open in Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Train_in-Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/arman-bd/guppylm/blob/main/train_guppylm.ipynb)

1. Set runtime to **T4 GPU**
2. **Run all cells** — downloads dataset, trains tokenizer, trains model, tests it
3. Upload to HuggingFace or download locally

### Train your own on your own computer

These steps are essentially the same as the Colab notebook line-by-line, but on your own machine.

Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

Inside the virtual environment, prepare the dataset:

    make tokenizer

Expected output starts with `Generating 60000 samples...`.

Pretrain, still from inside the virtual environment:

    make train

Expected output:

```
Device: cpu
GuppyLM: 8,726,016 params (8.7M)
Train: 57,000, Eval: 3,000

Training for 10000 steps...
  Step |         LR |      Train |       Eval |     Time
--------------------------------------------------------
     0 |   0.000000 |     8.5154 |         -- |     7.7s
   100 |   0.000150 |     5.7558 |         -- |   410.1s
   200 |   0.000300 |     3.2345 |         -- |   800.0s
   200 |   0.000300 |     4.4951 |     2.7429 |   843.9s
  -> Best model (eval=2.7429)
   300 |   0.000300 |     2.5016 |         -- |  1230.9s
   400 |   0.000300 |     2.0131 |         -- |  1607.8s
   400 |   0.000300 |     2.2573 |     1.7114 |  1650.2s
  -> Best model (eval=1.7114)
...
Done! 2768s, best eval: 0.3845
```

As soon as it saves at least one checkpoint, you can start chatting with the model (see section "Chat locally" below)

### Chat locally

```bash
make chat
```

This will create a Python virtual environment, install the requirements, train or download the model, and then start the chat.

```
You> the cat is looking at you
Guppy> i hide behind the plant when the furry one comes.

You> it is raining outside
Guppy> i think rain is the best thing about outside.
```

In interactive chat mode, the conversation grows and quickly runs into the 128-token limit, reducing quality.
You can also invoke chat with a single prompt, and exit after the response:

```bash
python -m guppylm chat --prompt "tell me a joke"
```

Finally type `exit` to end the chat and then:

```bash
deactivate
```

to leave the Python virtual environment that was created as part of the `make chat` command.

Run

```bash
make clean
```

to clean up the virtual environment with all the dependencies to recover the disk space taken by guppy's dependencies.

## Design Decisions

**Why no system prompt?** Every training sample had the same one. A 9M model can't conditionally follow instructions — the personality is baked into the weights. Removing it saves ~60 tokens per inference.

**Why single-turn only?** Multi-turn degraded at turn 3-4 due to the 128-token context window. A fish that forgets is on-brand, but garbled output isn't. Single-turn is reliable.

**Why vanilla transformer?** GQA, SwiGLU, RoPE, and early exit add complexity that doesn't help at 9M params. Standard attention + ReLU FFN + LayerNorm produces the same quality with simpler code.

**Why synthetic data?** A fish character with consistent personality needs consistent training data. Template composition with randomized components (30 tank objects, 17 food types, 25 activities) generates ~16K unique outputs from ~60 templates.
